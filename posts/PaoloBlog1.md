Hello!<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="20px"> I started learning to write code in October 2020. Before that point the only things I had ever earned a certification in were soldering/wiring and excel. Now that 8 months have gone by at the time of writing this, I have learned a lot about programming, mostly with JavaScript.[markdownum](http://insunt.org/inpositaque),

1. There is a place for everyone in tech 👫
2. It has the potential to change my life drastically for the better 🧬
3. It has the potential to change the world 🌍
4. I love doing it 💜

## I belong here 😏

Many people who try to learn this stuff on their own, or with help from the community, are often riddled with different forms of negitivity. Sometimes that can stem from feedback we get as people just starting out. It had an effect on me. I felt those feeling of inadequacy and even sometimes guilt and pain. The more we persevere, though, the easier it gets to thwart those feelings and truly grow as a developer.

## Life 🧬

```
Caelestia Ganymedes gentis. Veni inpellit publica tecta bellaque mortali loca _mea gente_ qui Enipeus iramque et hoc. _Altera Rex vetitum_; hoc magis dolores
```

## The World 🌍

Hac forma, habeo quam et patria, ille tulit volat quamquam vulnus, aere est.
Ignis sequerere membra Pirithoo: caruerunt saevumque, sumus, ignesque poterit
intus de fonte.

## Love 💞

Abigitque limite. Ipsa levis extulit munera, litora, ira pavet in morte, **te
in** quas [vix](http://auxiliumquefando.net/vocibus-cum). Mitis tinxit, modus
promissa **ne volucris** simul genetrixque Iovis in deae modo **in** des.
_Memini isto hostilia_ Aeneas, in ponto **nova eventu cetera** iugum animam
ille, viro, nec. Loquendi aves insisto saecula premente nec, at ego poscit ubi
sub!

- Tristis natorum ora talia patriis famae naidas
- Deus scilicet male miliaque noctisque invenio Nilum
- Efficerentque devexaque foret haec leve ab fertilis

Institerat quantum facies parientem, crepitantis nondum. Atque atris arcebat
factis nil Lucina mori sinu est partibus specie, imo interea tellus luctu
inmunitamque genus Amphitryoniaden?
